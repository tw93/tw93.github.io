title: 2017 Summary - No Procrastination
date: 2018-02-19 16:00:00
summary: A bit irrelevant to the title, always wanted to write an article about life, summarize 2017, and plan 2018. Procrastinated from before Spring Festival to the fourth day of Chinese New Year. Should say 2017 liked procrastination very much, so named `No Procrastination`. Hope not to procrastinate when encountering things in 2018, do it when thought of.

# 2017

What is the meaning of life? "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" says:

> To see this world,things dangerous to come to,To see behind walls,to draw closer,To find each other and to feel,That is the purpose of life.

Unfortunately, at this age, I haven't fully realized the above truth. Currently, what I can realize about the meaning of life is **to have things I want to do, look forward to tomorrow, and have people I am willing to love**. Actually, it is composed of **Work && Technology, Life && Love**.

## Work && Technology

<table style="max-width: 460px;"><tr><td><img src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/rmsportal/VvRFecQxnfveoNCvEhww.JPG" width="220"></td><td><img src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/rmsportal/IHsPMzcJIUjtCXlyNzvE.JPG" width="220"></td></tr></table>

It has been 950 days since graduating in July 2015 and coming to Alibaba. After doing H5 ticket related business in Beijing for a year, turned Base to Hangzhou in July 16 until now. In short 2+ years experienced Kissy, React, ReactNative, Weex, iOS project development. Met **good senior brothers and good boss's guidance and support**, can set Kpi for myself, only then have many opportunities to do things I want to do. Very lucky and grateful.

Keywords for work in 17 are **Promotion to 6, Channel Business, Weex + Ui, Double Eleven, Open Source, iOS** etc.

### Business Related

Mainly wrote some channel businesses with Weex from 0, including pit stepping research, rich interaction implementation, subsequent component extraction and business iteration maintenance. This probably spent **about 20% of my time in a year's work**.

### Weex Ui Layer Construction

Mainly refers to some basic constructions that can be implemented at Weex code layer. This probably **spent about 50% of my time in a year's work**, mainly including:

- **Weex Ui component library construction, open source, community maintenance**
- **Weex Fliggy Double Eleven venue performance experience optimization**
- **Weex rich interaction research and introduction, rich text solution implementation**
- Weex downgrade solution research and implementation, accessibility research, automated testing exploration, version upgrade follow-up promotion
- Weex business component extraction, holiday channel general business solution
- Weex market co-construction, Fliggy & UC Weex co-construction, Qingzhou platform component library co-construction

Among the above, worth mentioning are **[Weex Ui Component Library](https://github.com/alibaba/weex-ui){:target="_blank"} construction open source** and **Weex Fliggy Double Eleven Venue Performance Experience Optimization** these two things.

<small style="margin-left:20px">Left: Weex Ui Sample Room &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right: Fliggy Double Eleven Venue Effect</small>

The former experienced a small year from initial use inside Fliggy to extensive use by dozens of BUs in the group and finally to extensive use by external Weex developers. Currently open source version external usage data is **2154 star, 268 fork, 18K downloads**, highest reaching 6K/month usage.

The latter is mainly 17 Double Eleven Weex optimization special project. Spent almost a month optimizing venue Weex performance. **Effect is smoother than Tmall Double Eleven venue. Finally was called to exchange experience with Tmall students.**

Details can be seen in [**《Weex + Ui - Weex Conf 2018》**](http://tw93.github.io/2018-01-21/weex-conf-weex-ui.html){:target="_blank"} article and [**《Weex + Ui》**](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/os/rmsportal/VCbkwAttfbolWixThpNc.pdf){:target="_blank"} Keynote.

### iOS Development

If talking about the most surprising thing in technology in 2017? That should be stepping into iOS development at the end of the year. Initially just for optimizing Weex performance, only knew simple debugging and performance testing, these very "civilian science" things.

Thought about playing around at that time, widening technology stack. Never thought would write iOS online business code, meanwhile slowly modifying some Weex iOS code.

Currently only at entry level, can understand code, can run through online release process, [**Can do iOS business development**](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/os/rmsportal/NMtqzADzJjCotqznFNHA.mp4){:target="_blank"}, now mainly maintaining outbound supermarket iOS part. Understanding these probably **spent 15% of my time in a year's work**. Hope in 2018, toss some fun things on iOS well, looking forward very much.

### Technology && Learning

This part mainly belongs to **important but not urgent things**, mainly including reading technical articles, reading books, writing technical articles, sharing these 4 parts. This probably spent **15% of my time in a year**, less than 2016. At the same time, time spent on 1 is more than 234. Need to reflect on myself here, strive to correct in 2018.

There is a bit too much water in technical article reading. A lot of time wasted on browsing Zhihu, Weibo. But persisted in reading Qiwu Weekly, FEX Technical Weekly, JavaScript Weekly these and some other RSS.

Didn't read many books. Actually should calm down and read books well, benefits will be great:

- [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://book.douban.com/subject/1148282/){:target="_blank"}
- [iOS Programming (4th Edition)](https://book.douban.com/subject/26287812/){:target="_blank"}

Article output is low from 2017 to now, total 6 pieces. Release time is interesting, looks like all during holidays when not busy. Shouldn't use busy as excuse here.

Sharing in 2017 was very few, only 3. However there was a breakthrough, invited to participate in 2018 Weex conf conference sharing, made myself a bit bolder.

- Department Sharing: "Hello Weex"
- Alibaba Taoxianda Cross-BU Sharing: "Fliggy weex Technology System"

## Life && Love

What is life? Remember middle school politics book said this:

> Life is the sum of material life and spiritual life. Material life is the basic need of human life, while spiritual life is another spiritual sustenance pursued by people after obtaining material life.

Now material life basis can be satisfied, should put more on spiritual life.

WeChat signature in 17 is "Contentment makes happiness, love life". Want to live **more meaningfully**, please myself and people I like more, meanwhile less "contentious" i.e. "indifferent". This still needs to be cultivated well. Sometimes not calm when encountering things, actually very bad.

### Habits

Habit is also magical. Sometimes after persisting for a while, can continue to persist for a long time. But as long as not persisting for a day or two, will be lost for a while again. **Perseverance is easier said than done.**

Habits persisted in 17 are **Keep, bookkeeping, writing diary**. There are some others basically three days fishing two days drying nets.

**Keep fitness is a good thing**, can bring many changes, including image, next day spirit, mentality etc. In 2017 finally reduced the meat accumulated in 16, from 143 to 130. But in winter due to too cold and Spring Festival (excuse) lost again. Need to continue after returning from holiday this year.

<table><tr><td><img src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/rmsportal/drVhMcogRRCOeaSJSICQ.JPG" width="460"></td><td><img src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/rmsportal/KYDiUPNayeqzQNwTjpzk.PNG" width="460"></td><td><img src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/rmsportal/nliLlMPgMrbYAPhgOtnH.JPG" width="200"><img src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/rmsportal/MfblKcJKgXEKFLyUSOZj.JPG" width="200"></td></tr></table>

Bookkeeping is to better see expenditure classification of each month, better allocate money usage, meanwhile better manage finance.

Writing diary mainly through Grid Diary asking myself way. What did I do today, what to do tomorrow, what did I eat, interesting things. Total recorded 240+ pieces, 800+ life record photos. Mainly want to make every day different. Every day different is actually hard, but **just don't pass life taking month as unit**.

### Habits

Obviously felt 2017 character "a bit impatient". Not calm like veteran when encountering things. Root of "impatient" should be related to not handling mentality well. How not to be influenced by surroundings, not follow trend, how to stick to own values need to reflect well.

Meanwhile like procrastination. Sometimes a thing was originally to be done right now, but because heart always waiting for a specific procrastination time to do, or do until before eyes, causing many times do after a long time or directly silently gave up. The most obvious is sometimes work plan arranged for one day, finally may take a week to complete. This is very failed.

"Not sunny" is also a "defect" of 2017. Meanwhile like to say bad words, often have some negative energy. These are all bad. Many times good mood really high efficiency in doing anything, and will feel life is very meaningful. "Not sunny" sometimes is made not sunny by outside world, sometimes is made by own "zuo". This is very unlucky. Smile more, don't say bad words, meanwhile "sunnier" affecting people around is the correct way.

Always playing with phone in gathering activities is also a "disease" of 2017. Many times seeing photos accidentally taken by others are looking down at phone, looking very wretched even ugly. Meanwhile makes people feel not gregarious. Have disease need to cure. Need to learn chatting more (but programmers feel mostly like this, awkward). Look at phone less in gatherings.

Sitting posture not correct, hunchback when typing code. This problem is actually also serious. Need to remind myself often. Sitting like this is really ugly.

Arranging plan through GTD is a bit too much. Arrange several things every day, result did a little bit and didn't finish, then continue to arrange next day. This is actually bad. 2018 should focus, complete things one by one quickly, so efficiency output will be higher.

### Love

If talking about the biggest luck in 2017? That should be being with Lele. Fate is really a very wonderful thing.

<table style="max-width: 640px;"><tr><td><img src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/rmsportal/ivGbuZcwXajLdfAKZNNg.JPG" width="430"></td><td><img src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/rmsportal/mWvohRCHkCDBvSiPMeoq.JPG" width="240"></td></tr></table>

In 2017 experienced early summer to deep winter together, experienced Beijing-Hangzhou separation to Hangzhou convergence. Didn't adapt much, natural feeling. There are many places worth learning from each other in character. Very content. Strive forward together in 2018.

# 2018

Time passes really super fast. Especially after working, passing year by year feels like a blink of an eye. Really don't want to finish my life in units of months or even years. Should have some new experiences, new life, new changes every year.

2018 plan needs to think well. Better not set too many Flags, wait for verification of time. Several things need to plan are as follows:

- [ ] Deeply understand iOS, participate in more cross-end development things
- [ ] Learn blockchain technology and artificial intelligence
- [ ] Learn to summarize, say less nonsense, meanwhile write more code
- [ ] Make a work satisfied by myself
- [ ] Persist Keep + Diary + Bookkeeping, learn to invest funds
- [ ] Times of going home greater than 2, take family to play once
- [ ] Sunny + Say less bad words + Not impetuous + Good schedule
- [ ] Treat Lele sincerely, care attentively, travel once

### 2018 No Procrastination, and be a civilized person
