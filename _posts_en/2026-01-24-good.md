Last week, while shopping for New Year's Eve gifts for my team, I casually asked on X: what's the most satisfying thing you've bought in the past year, or if you had to recommend just one thing, what would it be? Electronics, software, or everyday items—anything goes.

To my surprise, I received 243 responses from friends. The energy was incredible and I absolutely loved this kind of exchange. The comment section was buzzing with conversation. After going through everything several times, I discovered so many great finds—ranging from essential needs to down-to-earth lifestyle products.

I've compiled the recommendations based on popularity, preserving everyone's original feedback while making minor adjustments to punctuation and redundant expressions. Each line starts with the product name, keeping everything authentic. Hopefully this can serve as a reference when you want to buy something but don't know where to start.

1. Gaideer Floor Drain Core: Bought this after seeing it on Uncle Dou's tweet. Previous water-seal drains would get clogged with biofilm and hair, draining slower and requiring frequent cleaning. This one has never clogged once—drainage stays smooth. After monitoring it for a while, I replaced all other drains in the house.
2. Heated Towel Rack: Haven't seen anyone recommend this on X yet. It's a smartphone-connected towel rack with timer settings. Towels breed bacteria quickly once damp. A rack that heats to 60°C regularly gives towels that sun-dried sanitizing effect, and they're warm after bathing without the stiff texture of sun-dried towels.
3. E-reader: After buying it, I've kept my phone out of bed and read for about an hour before sleep. Looking back after half a year, I've read quite a few books and papers. Totally worth it.
4. Tesla Model 3
5. iPhone Air: eSIM is convenient, switching carriers during business trips and travel is hassle-free. Best generation yet, incredibly smooth. Perfect for developers managing multiple numbers, immersive translation, quickly switching between dev and test environments.
6. iPad mini: One of this year's top happiness-boosting items. Light, portable, great for reading code or auxiliary development, easy on the eyes with long battery life.
7. Midea Baseboard Heater: Completely silent, auto temperature control, much more comfortable than air conditioning. Voice or WeChat mini-program control. After buying it, clothes stay dry even on humid days.
8. Anki: Started using Anki to learn Swedish. Free, and it's working great.
9. Dupilumab: If I had to recommend one thing from 2025, it's not electronics but this injection I got—Dupilumab. It's mainly for treating rhinitis and asthma. The first few days after the first two shots, nothing happened, but after four or five days, I could suddenly smell things. Smelling coffee for the first time made me so happy.
10. Blumaan Boulevard Lamp: Bought it for my kid initially, but discovered it's amazing. I use it for home office too. The brightness difference is night and day. High brightness makes work comfortable. Has a night mode with upward lighting that's not glaring, very convenient for taking care of kids at night.
11. Coconut Powder: Nanguo brand, mix with oatmeal every morning. Tastier than milk, never gets old.
12. Semiconductor ETF: Earned back my basic living expenses.
13. iPad mini, AirPods Pro 3, Anker 10000mAh mini, Mac mini M4, Dove large bowl: If I had to pick items that boosted my happiness most this year, these would be it.
