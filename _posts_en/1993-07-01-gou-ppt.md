Two years ago:
Apple = Alibaba + Tencent + Meituan + JD + Pinduoduo
China held five spots in the top ten global enterprises.
<br><br>
Two years later:
Apple = Total market cap of all mainstream Chinese internet companies + $1.2465 trillion.

13 years ago, my dad was sacrificed in the 3000-point financial defense battle. <br>

# Layoffs = Graduation

1. Epidemic recession affecting production and consumption.
2. Dividend period is over; growth is sluggish; supply exceeds demand.
3. Deepening regulation and anti-monopoly measures.
4. Survival first; [labor costs](http://media-meituan.todayir.com/20220419164002110010215763_tc.pdf) are the main expense.

# Common Myths

1. "I'm super busy, so my rating must be good." (Hard work != Good result)
2. "I'm the best coder, so my rating must be good."
3. "I want to build a fancy platform regardless of long-term value."
4. "I'm not the owner, so it's not my result."
5. "TL will believe my self-bragging in the review."

# Why are some people unhappy?

---

<h2 style="color:#E44258">Because their "lying flat" and their "effort" are not pure enough, hence the suffering.</h2>

# Energy Management is Crucial

- Manage energy, not time. Full engagement brings efficiency, health, and happiness.

- Steps: Desire -> Reality -> Action.

---

- Exercise and Diet
- More time for family
