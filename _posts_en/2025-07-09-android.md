### Why did I stop insisting on the iPhone?

I can only say that Apple has not been very enterprising in recent years. I used to look forward to the annual press conference and would switch to the new model at the first time, but I always feel that there have been no changes in recent years, especially in the AI part. There is nothing fun at the system level, and it is more of a digital upgrade of the system version. At the same time, I don't like the feeling of being "kidnapped". Watches, headphones, and computers are all in one system. I prefer to choose freely, and use whichever I like, to prevent being kidnapped deeper. I was thinking whether to try Android.

My previous phone was a 15 Pro Max. The screen was great for watching videos/articles, but it was really too big in the summer, especially when I put it in my shorts pocket. It was like carrying a brick in my pocket. At the same time, it was not easy to hold with one hand, especially when my fingers were holding it and there was still a little bit of space left, which made it easy to play with.

### Why did I choose what I chose in Android?

The first thing I considered was a small-screen machine that I could hold with one hand. I went to the store and looked at the vivo X200 Pro mini, Xiaomi 15, OnePlus 13T, and iPhone 16E. They are all around 6.3-inch machines. Among them, only the OPPO's screen has a good look and feel, especially the text rendering, which looks more delicate. At the same time, it is the lightest of these, at 179g, and the bezel is also the narrowest.

In fact, many times what prevents iPhone users from migrating to Android is, in my opinion, the screen and font. People are creatures of habit. Suddenly seeing a screen that feels different from the iPhone, especially the font rendering of Android, basically persuades people to give up, because the reverse is also true. I haven't used an iPhone for about 20 days, and suddenly I feel very unaccustomed to it.

The ColorOS 15 system is much simpler than I thought. I played with the corresponding Xiaobu AI tool, which has a memory assistant, like a knowledge base for a large model, and can call the software's own capabilities at the system level. The playability is very suitable for me. I kind of want to complain about the iPhone 16E. It costs more than 4000, and it's just a rehash of the 13. But the back of the 16E is actually very beautiful.

### What are the advantages of Android and OPPO?

The first advantage, I think, is playability, especially changing the font. I replaced the system font with Cang'er Jinkai, which was originally the font of my WeChat reading. It is very comfortable and immediately upgrades the rough feeling of the original Android default font. Then there is a pain point for iPhone users, which is that many times the icons of domestic apps with psoriasis are pasted with advertising slogans. Android can basically change the icons, and you can even change them to the same icons as Apple's.

The second advantage is the convenience of the system, with various small details optimized. I now particularly like to use the AI assistant to help answer calls I don't want to answer. For calls, AI can record and summarize them. It has also learned from the good things about Apple, such as the Action button to quickly wake up, and various small details in the system, such as side wake-up, three-finger screenshots, scrolling screenshots, screen recording that can record multi-line sound, and application split screen. Of course, if you don't want to use them, you can also turn them off to make it very simple. The system comes with harassment interception and phone/SMS identification, which is also very convenient.

The third advantage is speed. ColorOS is really smooth and very fast. Another speed is the network itself. The network is still strong in elevators and basements. Especially when migrating phone data, it was directly transferred from the iPhone at 90M, and the data was almost all transferred in less than half an hour. This really broke my original idea. It turned out that I had been compromised by Apple for so many years.

The fourth is that many things can be turned off. For example, with the help of gkd, you can easily turn off system ads. The system settings themselves can turn off a lot of things. You can even hide the navigation bar at the bottom.

The fifth advantage is the high cost-effectiveness. The bezel of this machine is very narrow, very narrow, and the feel is very good. Especially, it finally got rid of the big notch and the big island. The minimalist style is very fond of it. Although the fingerprint unlock on the screen is not as good as the iPhone's unlock, it is also easy to get used to. The machine plus the national subsidy is only more than 3600, which is much more cost-effective than the 9000 PM.

The sixth is the speed of super fast charging. I never thought about it when I used an iPhone before. In the future, I don't need to charge my phone at night. I can just wake up in the morning, and the battery will be full while I'm brushing my teeth, washing my face, and eating breakfast. 5700 mAh, 80w charging, you can really see the battery level rising. This is very cool.

### So what are the disadvantages of Android phones?

The first disadvantage is that the phone gets hotter more easily than the iPhone, especially when downloading multiple applications continuously, synchronizing a lot of data, and shooting high-capacity videos. The heat is a small pain point, but it's okay for normal use.

The second disadvantage is that the consistency of the system and the aesthetic of the software are not as good as the iPhone's. However, ColorOS is very diligent and has done a lot of compatibility with the system itself, especially the compatibility of various apps. Most of them are done very well, but occasionally there are some inconsistencies, especially in the compatibility of some foreign apps with fonts and the bottom bar. For perfectionists, there is still some acceptance cost. Apple's ecosystem is still the first in the mobile phone.

The third disadvantage is the refined savings of the system. The sound quality of the external speaker is actually not as good as the iPhone's, but fortunately, I don't use the external speaker much, so it's acceptable. For example, although it is a 5700 mAh large battery, it does not feel as durable as the pro max's battery, which does not look large. However, it is no problem to meet the normal use for a day.

The fourth disadvantage is the linkage with the Apple system. Although OPPO is jokingly called OPhone, it is very good for the Apple ecosystem. For example, Live Photos, file transfer, and the availability of AirPods are all good. But for example, if I want to forward SMS verification codes to my Mac, transfer files to my Mac naturally without installing an app, the original Apple's notes and todo software are not easy to synchronize. However, these can actually be changed slowly by using the system.

### Possible concerns about changing systems?

I'm used to the software on the iPhone, am I worried that I won't have it on Android? This is not a big deal. If you are not the kind of person who has a lot of niche Apple software installed on your phone, you can basically find all the regular software. And even if you have your favorite font configured, it's really too comfortable.

At the same time, I'm worried that the Android machine will become slow after a year of use. Many iPhone users have this stubborn idea. I was the same at the time. In fact, the hardware of Android machines has already solved this problem. You will even feel that it is much smoother than the latest non-flagship version of the iPhone. I feel that it will not be a problem to use it for more than two years, because even if it is an iPhone, you will often have the desire to change your phone after 2 years.

Some people are also worried about security. In this regard, it is true that Android's customizability is much stronger than Apple's. By downloading and installing from Google Play or the system's own, it's actually fine if you don't mess around. But for example, some company employee office software and downloads from abnormal channels still need to pay attention to security. Maybe in the future, you can buy a backup digital version of the iPhone to solve this problem.

In short, I think this attempt has brought a positive user experience, and it has changed some of my own inherent views. Of course, you can also try it to prevent you from getting old and having no interest in changing your phone.
