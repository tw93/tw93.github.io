For engineers, besides solid professional skills, the ability to "do things clearly" is actually more important. Working effectively without confusion is more effective than working overtime.

This week, I shared this topic with the team. I'm not particularly good at talking about such soft skills, but I tried my best to explain some personal experiences on how engineers can "clarify, explain, and execute" things in a grounded way.
