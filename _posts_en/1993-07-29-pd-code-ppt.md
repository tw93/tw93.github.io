# Why not just "Front-end Engineer"?

---

## Definition of Front-end

- Wiki: Front-end is the part of a software system that interacts directly with users, while the back-end controls the output; separating software into front-end and back-end is an abstraction that separates different functional parts.

## Definition of Front-end Engineer

- Baidu: An engineer who uses professional skills and tools such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript to implement product UI designs into website products, covering user PC and mobile web pages, and handling visual and interaction issues.

<h1 style="color: #F14957">Also known as "the person who cuts pages" 🙊</h1>

---

## What is a Product Engineer?

- Definition: Someone who can convert pain points / ideas into products through technical means to make them more impactful.
- Boundary: Not limited by position or technology, focus more on solving problems with technical and product thinking.
- Process: <span style="color: #F14957">Pain point / Idea -> Product Thinking -> UI Design -> Development -> Product MVP -> Operation </span>
- Quality: Empathy, Curiosity, Logical Thinking, Data Sensitivity, Learning Ability.

# Where do pain points / ideas come from? <br/> "I have an idea, just need a programmer" 😵

---

# It's not only Product Managers who can make products <br/> And not everyone is a Product Manager

---

# A Good Product Manager

<!-- Identify user needs, think about product positioning, be responsible for the success or failure of the product... -->

1. Demand judgment: Collection -> Analysis -> Priority management.
2. Propose solutions: Flowcharts -> Wireframes -> PRD.
3. Project management: Initiation -> Planning -> Execution -> Monitoring -> Closing.
4. Validation: Ensure product meets standards and is delivered as intended.
5. Analysis and Support: User behavior, operational/financial effects.

---

# Transition Path from Front-end to Product Engineer

---

## 1. Treat every development as a product

---

# Negative Examples of Development

- Only a receiver in reviews, no suggestions.
- Ignorant of business pain points, data, and core problems.
- Too many bugs during testing.
- Default repository documentation: <span style="color: #F14957">No docs, no demo, no manual.</span>

---

# 2. Develop capability through technical productization

---

# Negative Examples of Technical Productization

- Can't explain what my technical capability does in one sentence.
- Barely usable for self, but painful for others.
- Looks like a "stitched-together" Demo.

---

## 3. Learning Sketch is much easier than learning Rust

---

# Sketch Tips

- <span style="color: #F14957">Goal-oriented: build something and learn as you go.</span>
- Borrow design ideas: [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/), [producthunt](https://www.producthunt.com/).
- It feels like assembling a page using component libraries once you're familiar.

---

# 4. Rapidly achieve product MVP

---

# What is Product MVP?

- Find problems <span style="color: #F14957">worth </span> solving, develop runnable solutions, build Minimum <span style="color: #F14957">Viable </span> Product.
- Is it a real problem? Is it worth solving?
- If yes, build the MVP.
- Are early users satisfied? If yes, productize; if no, optimize or pivot.

## 5. The most overlooked part: <span style="color: #F14957">Product Operation </span>

<small style="margin-top:24px">Whispering: Why does MiaoYan's Star history look like "cheating"? 🐶</small>

---

# Why did this happen?

- MiaoYan was written two years ago but only used by myself.
- This year I wrote two intro articles, and it took off. Now it has 5K users and [organic recommendations](https://medium.com/macoclock/5-amazing-macos-apps-i-use-5bb3de7a0858).
- "Good wine needs no bush" doesn't apply in a competitive tech world.
- <span style="color: #F14957">How to recommend your product in a friendly way is a science.</span>

---

# How to explain something clearly?

---

## If you only have 10min, how do you introduce your work? <br/> What if only <span style="color: #F14957">1min</span>? <br/> What if they are not a developer?

---

## How to judge if what you made is useful?

- Does it really solve a painful problem?
- Does it bring convenience value?
- Would users recommend it to friends?
- <span style="color: #F14957">Laziness Index </span>: New Product Value = (New Experience - Old Experience) - Migration Cost.

---

# Points for Product Engineers

---

## 1. Rehearse the path before coding

- <span style="color: #F14957">Explain the problem I solve in one sentence.</span>
- What features does my MVP need?
- How to finish it fast and well?
- Who is my user? How will they find it?

---

## 2. Product framework first, then feature filling

- Great products have <span style="color: #F14957">thought 6 iterations ahead </span> during the 1st one.
- Deciding what NOT to add is better than adding.
- <span style="color: #F14957">Would users feel regret if this feature is missing?</span>

---

## 3. Important points beyond code

- The "face" of the product: landing page, docs, love at first sight.
- User touchpoints: community, hubs, upgrades, Q&A.
- Continuous optimization for ease of use, aiming for <span style="color: #F14957">Aha Moments</span>.
- <span style="color: #F14957">Beautiful </span> products are important.
