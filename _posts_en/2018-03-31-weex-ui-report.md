Weex Ui was open sourced on September 30 last year. It has been exactly half a year since today. This article intends to share the Weex Ui half-year open source road from 5 parts: **origin, positioning, status quo, development, and outlook**.

### Origin of Weex Ui

Weex Ui originated from a Weex upper-layer Ui component library within Alibaba. After running for nearly a year, it was organized, optimized, enriched and qualified then open sourced, hoping to leverage the community to let it develop better and serve more developers.

### Positioning of Weex Ui

The positioning of Weex Ui is **a set of lightweight, rich interactive, high-performance Weex upper-layer Ui component library**. Through upper-layer Vue code, components are encapsulated with Native-level optimization, friendly supporting Weex iOS, Android, H5 basic environments. Provided to developers through front-end out-of-the-box thinking. At the same time, through Weex Ui code, students who have not contacted Weex can have reference for its writing.

### Finally

**The development of Weex Ui cannot be separated from the contribution of the community. Since open source, it has slowly removed Alibaba's characteristics and developed towards community.**

Thank every student who made suggestions and code contributions to Weex Ui, especially thank community [@zwwill](https://github.com/zwwill), [@GJJDD](https://github.com/GJJDD), [@Yanjiie](https://github.com/Yanjiie), [@zweipix](https://github.com/zweipix) and other students for their dedication.

Hope that in the future, more students can join the development of Weex Ui, so that everyone can happily use Weex Ui to improve efficiency and get off work early, while promoting its better development.

> **Please feel free to use and contribute to the development.**
