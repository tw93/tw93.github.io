summary: Recently I refined a macOS Markdown note application I made two years ago and released it for everyone to try.

## Reason

I started using Markdown during college. From WizNote at the beginning, to Marxico later, used Ulysses when working, then found Quiver and used it for a long time. I also used MWeb, bought Bear's annual membership, but finally, there was not a single one that satisfied me.

Ulysses main problem is that it has no preview function and is expensive.

Quiver is actually quite easy to use, but it has not been updated for more than 3 years. The author should have given up. Recently, the latest Mac system has certain compatibility problems when inputting.

Many people say MWeb is easy to use, but I think it is too complicated.

Bear is really beautiful, but many Markdown formats are incompatible, so I finally gave up.

3 years ago, when I was learning iOS development myself, I slowly thought about making a note application. So during the Chinese New Year the year before last, I coded crazily for a while and the rough mold could run. I used it myself. Since the beginning of this year, I have slowly optimized it during weekends. I took it as a happy way to code and improved this tool. I feel it is okay to use (can't say it's excellent). I thought I could start releasing it for everyone to try and help give suggestions.

## Re-introduction

For more introduction, see [Github/MiaoYan](https://github.com/tw93/MiaoYan), I won't be too wordy here.

This software is called **MiaoYan**. "Miao Bu Ke Yan" means very wonderful words, roughly this meaning, and it looks quite elegant.

Written in Swift, compared to the pure Web shell way, the experience is much better. Haha, you should have had enough of the shell MacOS applications.

Just made a official website using pure HTML over the weekend, which was relatively fast. At the same time, the software also supports English, as follows. Suddenly I felt like a wild designer.
