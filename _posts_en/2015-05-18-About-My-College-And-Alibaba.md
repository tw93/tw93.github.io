### About Title

Only want to rely on both hands, waving to the ideal, this is a lyric from Beyond's "No Longer Hesitate". Probably since middle school I liked listening to Beyond's songs, intermittently all the way to university. Every time I watch their previous concert videos, I am especially excited and moved. Most of what they bring me is positive energy and a cool spirit. Returning to the article, this article mainly records the process of finding a job myself, and summarizes the campus life of four years of university by the way.

### About Offers

#### Recruitment in September was not ideal

For campus recruitment, there were only 3 units I participated in interviews: Baidu, Tencent, and Huawei. For others, either the written test didn't pass, or I didn't want to go myself. Since I interned at Huawei in Xi'an from July 2014 to October 2014, in 3 months I made an information self-service platform and a simple system for data document reading for the department by myself. Therefore, people in the department wanted me to stay and work on Web for them. Later, with the help of the supervisor, I took a green channel inside. After a simple interview, I got an offer. At that time, because of previous rounds of written tests and running around for other companies, several of us partners looking for jobs together were basically exhausted, physically and more mentally. Therefore, under Huawei's signing time requirements, I hastily signed the tripartite agreement.

#### Preparing to look for a job again in October

The Huawei signing was around late September. I went home for a while during National Day, resting for about a week. During that time, I thought about it roughly and felt I couldn't be like this. I must find a job again, mainly for these three reasons:

- Location reason: Since the department's main technology was in Chengdu, I would later be assigned from Xi'an to Chengdu. Since ancient times, there has been a saying "Don't enter Sichuan when young, don't leave Sichuan when old". My nature doesn't like a stable life, I love the struggling life in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen more.
- Job content reason: In fact, I was not mainly doing Web front-end inside, also including WeChat side, background and some other things. But I learned that Huawei's background mostly used Java. I don't know Java at all, and I don't want to do Java. And due to too many middle-level leaders, it's not very easy to do one thing well.
- Salary reason: Huawei's salary in second-tier cities was 8K before tax, and finally less than 7K in hand. Compared with my previous income from Web commercial projects, I thought Huawei's salary was not what I dreamed of.

#### Learn! Learn! Learn!

Based on these reasons, I decided to look for a job again after returning to school in October. At the same time, I analyzed my strengths and weaknesses. My strength was that I had relatively much project experience, and my weakness was mainly that my basic knowledge was not solid. Especially the knowledge in JavaScript. Many times I knew how to use it, but when I was asked about the principle, I could roughly remember where it was in the "Telescope" book (JavaScript: The Definitive Guide), but I couldn't explain it clearly. I suffered a lot from this in the Baidu interview. Therefore, I started to study JavaScript and CSS with my heart instead of just taking a quick look. At the same time, since I participated in the development of the commercial project "Where to Learn" later and was responsible for all the front-end, I realized that my understanding of new things was really very little. I hadn't heard of tools like Git, Github, Bower, Yeoman, Grunt before, let alone Angular and Node, such good things. Through the "Where to Learn" project and working with a group of very excellent people for a whole month, I learned a lot of new things and took the initiative to learn many new things. After that time, there were few courses, and time was relatively sufficient. So I just wanted to learn more things with one heart, and started using Github and writing technical blogs with my heart. I answered questions on Zhihu in my spare time. The winter vacation in 2014 was very long, so I bought "Pro Node.js" (深入浅出 Nodejs), and borrowed the "Telescope" book again in the library, as well as "High Performance JavaScript", Mr. Zhou Aimin's "The Essence and Programming Practice of JavaScript Language", Guo Xin's "Building High Performance Web Sites" from Xidian, and "JavaScript Design Patterns", these famous books in front-end to study. I had previously read several of them once or twice, but they were all simple reads. That winter vacation was the vacation where I learned my favorite technology the most during my four years of university.

During this time, while studying from books, I made my own Node [twMovie open source project](https://github.com/tw93/twMovie){:target="_blank"} and pushed it to Github. Later, I used Github Pages to build a personal blog, moved some of my previously readable articles over, and started writing articles. Besides, I didn't want trouble, so I directly used Github's Readme.md to rewrite my resume.

#### Participating in Alibaba's supplemental recruitment

It was probably when the winter vacation was half over that I saw the news of Alibaba's front-end supplemental recruitment. I was really very very excited when I saw it, and I particularly longed for the atmosphere of Alibaba's front-end work. So I immediately sent my resume address on Github over. I didn't make another PDF version of my resume, as I thought remaking an electronic resume was a waste of time.

After a few days, I received a phone interview. At the very beginning, the first round was an interviewer from Hangzhou. He asked me many basic front-end questions, and then asked some things on my resume on Github and some project-related questions. It lasted about 40 minutes. We had a very happy conversation, and I wasn't nervous at all, more excited. After about 5 minutes, I received a phone call from Bachi for the second round. I admire Mr. Bachi very much and am very grateful to him. When starting the phone interview, he asked some front-end questions and also many questions related to my Node project. The questions were deeper than those of the previous interviewer. The phone interview also lasted about 40 minutes. However, after this interview, I didn't feel very good about myself. I didn't answer several questions well, but I had no regrets.

After the phone interview ended, I didn't receive any notice for a while. After that, I had been studying Angularjs related things. In early March, I bought a plane ticket back to Xi'an from home. Around March 4, when I was just having dinner, I received a call from Bachi, telling me that I had passed all the previous interviews, but for the final technical round, I needed to come to the company for an interview. Without hesitation, I immediately agreed and scheduled the time and place. Initially, I scheduled for the 11th in Beijing, intending to fly back to Xi'an first and then fly to Beijing for the interview. Later, when checking Beijing flights, I found that the time for the 2 am flight was inconvenient for accommodation, and there were no sleepers or even seats on the train from Beijing back to Xi'an. So I changed to going to Hangzhou for the interview. Going from home to Hangzhou was very convenient, directly taking the high-speed rail near my home to Hangzhou, about 4 hours. Then I stayed there for a few days, time was sufficient, and finally flew back to Xi'an from Hangzhou. So from the 5th, I started arranging the itinerary, refunded the plane ticket from home to Xi'an (refund only returns fuel tax and insurance oh), and booked a hotel. In the evening, I contacted my high school buddy Tang Zhou, telling him about my coming for the interview. He immediately said he would host me. For the next few days, thanks to him, the living and diet were arranged by him, and I could focus on preparing for the interview.

I set off from home at noon on March 10, arrived in Hangzhou around 5 pm. After my buddy treated me to dinner, I rested for a night. The next day at noon, I took a bus from Zhejiang University to the Taobao City for the interview. The questions in this interview were much deeper than the first two, including the implementation principles of some underlying framework libraries, and I even wrote programs. It lasted about an hour. I gained a lot from the interview, the interviewer was very friendly, and I was more certain of my direction. After the interview ended, after waiting for about 20 minutes, the interviewer discussed the results with the previous interviewer. After a while, the boss sent a message, telling me that the technical interview had passed, and there would be a video interview with HR in the evening. I jumped with excitement outside the UED building. I felt that many surprising or moving things during my four years of university happened during this time.

Returning to Zhejiang University in the evening, my buddy looked for a place for the video interview for me, and finally chose the 1897 Cafe at Zhejiang University, the environment was very good. Around 8 o'clock was the HR interview. It was my first time experiencing an HR interview. The HR mainly asked me some questions about my attitude towards things and values, and some questions I thought were pressure interviews. However, I answered all the questions sincerely, because at that step, the result was no longer important. That process was already a big improvement for me. Finally, due to slow network speed, it was changed to a phone interview, also about an hour.

After the interview ended, I sent a WeChat Moment "The road ahead is still long, don't be happy with external things and don't be sad about self-loss".

#### Visiting West Lake

Afterwards, I went to West Lake to see the night view for a while and relaxed my mood.
![West Lake at Night]({{ site.assetUrl }}hznight.jpg){:class="img-zoom"}

On March 12, I played in Hangzhou for a day, cycling around West Lake. And I ate famous Hangbang cuisine at Green Tea. The taste was completely different from Hunan and Xi'an, giving a feeling of just having some snacks. It was very sweet and light. Hangbang cuisine was made particularly exquisitely and beautifully, making people like it very much. The following pictures are: Green Tea Cake, Pineapple Fritters with Shrimp, Bread Sensation (highly recommended), Roasted Fish.

In the distance is the Leifeng Pagoda, reminding me of Lady White Snake.

The picture below seems to have a feeling of a hanging jade hook at West Lake.
![West Lake]({{ site.assetUrl }}xh3.jpg){:class="img-zoom"}

I came to the airport by airport bus in the evening and stayed at a hotel there.

On March 13, I took an 8 am flight, arrived in Xi'an around 11 am. I was extremely hungry and bought a big Roujiamo and a bottle of Ice Peak at the airport. It was very satisfying to eat. After that, I took the airport bus back to school.
![Roujiamo and Ice Peak]({{ site.assetUrl }}rjm.jpg){:class="img-zoom"}

On March 20, I received a call from the HR. I was super happy, or super excited. At that moment, I really felt that what I did was very very worth it. When your direction is correct, you will receive rewards after paying effort.

### Breaking contract with Huawei

After receiving the offer from Alibaba, with the consent of Alibaba's HR, I would send the new tripartite agreement after getting it around May 1st. The HR said a sentence that moved me: "Because of trust, so it is simple!".

#### Preparing for contract breach

Advice to students who see this article: be cautious when signing, be cautious when signing, be cautious when signing; breaching contract is troublesome, breaching contract is troublesome, breaching contract is troublesome (Zhihu habit, important things need to be said three times to be effective).

Breaching contract and getting a new tripartite agreement at Xidian was very troublesome and took a long time. Xidian stipulated that the application for contract breach and receiving the tripartite agreement must wait until after May 1st to be handled. That is to say, they only accept your contract breach application on May 4th, and you must have the receiving letter from the new company, the breach letter from the old company, 4 copies of the old tripartite agreement, and the school's breach application form (requires the signature of the vice secretary of the college to be effective).

Breaching contract with Huawei was also troublesome. The company wouldn't handle your breach application so casually. They only started handling your breach application on the first working day of May. Around May 5th, they would send the first batch of emails about the breach handling process, and subsequently send the second and third batches. After you receive the email about the handling process, fill it out as required and submit it to the Huawei headquarters in the local city. Then it took about a week for department review before they gave you the breach letter. That is to say, the earliest batch wouldn't get the breach letter until May 12th.

I called to submit the breach application around early April. After HR recorded it, they said there would be a notice to handle it around May 1st. So for me, the waiting time was not very long, about more than a month. But in our change QQ group, many students applied for breach around October last year and had to wait for nearly half a year. This feeling of waiting would make you very anxious. So be cautious when signing, breaching is troublesome. Think well before signing. If you are thinking of taking an offer from company X as a backup first and then looking for other companies, and wait until there is a good company to breach the original company, you will be very painful. I suggest in this case just don't sign at first, otherwise you will be in trouble. That is to say, don't compromise on certain things for the sake of making do, and the same goes for love.

Regarding the matter of finding the vice dean for stamping, I probably went more than ten times before I got it done. I won't go into details here. I suggest asking the counselor for the corresponding leader's phone number and making an appointment with him by SMS to handle the signature, so you won't miss him time after time like me.

After I handled all these things, the time I received the new tripartite agreement was May 18th. After filling out the tripartite agreement, I immediately sent it to the company via SF Express.

Due to handling household registration procedures, the tripartite agreement stayed at Alibaba for more than 20 days and was sent back to school on the 26th. On June 29th, everything was done and I submitted two copies to the school. The tripartite agreement matter was officially handled.

#### About Huawei

Since I interned at Huawei before, I can talk about my feelings about Huawei. In fact, Huawei is not as bad as most people who don't like it say, nor as good as most people who like it say. My feelings are:

- Information security is well done: Generally, you cannot bring electronic devices like mobile phones into those strictly controlled places. You cannot use the mobile phone camera function inside the company. You need to check your bag when leaving the company, and you are not allowed to plug USB into computers. As a result, for a while after my internship ended, I was not used to using the mobile phone camera function.
- Overtime is not as serious as everyone thinks: I have heard many many people say how serious Huawei's overtime is. Actually, my experience was okay. In Xi'an, the department with more serious overtime is the wireless department, but they give more year-end bonuses than other departments. Inside, it's generally busier for a period of time before project submission, other times depend on you individually.
- People in the department are very nice: Relationships in the department were relatively harmonious, at least in the department I was in. They were all very good. We often went out for dinner and played badminton together. Relationships were similar to those between college classmates.
- Internet atmosphere is not good: Or rather, there is no internet atmosphere. Huawei's communication aspects, hardware, and enterprise applications are all very powerful. But in Web aspects, the technology was about the level of several years ago. The code was relatively ancient, hadn't been updated, and few people were willing to update and optimize it.

Finally, say thank you: "Thanks to the supervisor, mentor and colleagues for their help". My mentor, supervisor and colleagues were really good to me during my internship. Many times when I had new ideas and wanted to make something, but didn't have resources at my position, they were very willing to help me apply for and look for corresponding resources.

### My University

Time flies like a shuttle, years are like a song. There is only more than a month left of university. In four years of university, I have been happy, moved, cried, lost, and hesitated. University life is very rich and colorful. I have experienced what should be experienced, and experienced many things that shouldn't be experienced. In short, I am very content, no regrets.

#### Freshmen year was a bit hesitant

I still remember when I just entered university, I took everything in university life as very fresh. At that time, I was also very happy to be assigned to the School of Telecommunications with a low score of 603, which was a very lucky thing. I thought the School of Telecommunications was very awesome in Xidian. Now thinking about it, it was just too young, too simple, so much so that during my junior year, I wanted to go to the School of Computer Science to learn science and culture.

At the very beginning, I was very hesitant, doing whatever others did, having no goal of my own.

I was very honest in my freshmen year. Many times I was too shy in public. My Mandarin was not very standard then. After speaking Hunanese for seventeen years consecutively in Hunan, speaking Mandarin was really an unaccustomed thing.

I was also a study commissary in freshmen year in a muddle. At that time, I took study as the first priority, soaking in the library when I had nothing to do, learning advanced mathematics and physics, giving a feeling of doing problems before the college entrance examination. However, it was of no use. The average score in the first semester was only in the 70s, not even one scholarship. Thinking back now, the study method at that time was very wrong.

In freshmen year, I was also pulled into the Art Department of the Student Union by a senior sister. Thinking back now, the Art Department should be the only organization I participated in in university, and the only organization I did until the end. During the period, I planned and organized large-scale evenings such as the college welcoming evening, school dance competition, and eight-school fellowship with the department. I was responsible for the prompting work of the evening, mainly communicating details with the evening performers, confirming some performance requirements, and acting as a bridge between the stage and the actors. Later, I gradually dared to speak in public. Joining the student union gained a group of good friendships, there are too many interesting things to say.

However, I was really very hesitant this year. My grades were not as good as others, and I never thought about recommended postgraduate study. I just thought about studying well, going to classes honestly, and finishing all the homework. Besides that, I had no sense of direction and didn't know what I wanted. Then after finishing homework, I would soak in the library 203 to read literary books if I had time. I went to be a literary dog that year. Probably that year I finished reading all of Han Han's books. At that time, I thought Han Han was cool and liked that style of life. After that, I occasionally read Hai Yan's "Deep Prison" and thought the story development was very tortuous. I loved it, so I finished reading all of Hai Yan's books again.

The first semester of freshmen year was just hesitation, thinking that what senior brothers and sisters said was the truth, they were all right, and listening to their suggestions could pass the exams. Actually not. Everyone's method is different. Now I am also an old senior, but I don't really want to give juniors suggestions about shortcuts for study and exams, like doing previous test papers before the exam to pass. I almost don't say such things. Generally, it's like, practice C language more if you have time.

In the first semester of freshmen year, there was a good habit of staying in the library to study if there was nothing to do.

In the second semester of freshmen year, the major offered an interest course called Database Systems. The teacher at that time was Zhang Yueyu. In university, he was the only teacher who made me follow his thoughts in class, and also the only teacher I wanted to ask questions. And at that time, due to buying a laptop, I could install SQL on the computer to practice. I almost finished practicing the subsequent ones when the teacher only lectured one chapter. Then I went to the library to find books to read, practicing building databases and building data tables. When I didn't understand, I sent emails to the teacher, and the teacher was also very happy to answer. Finally, when looking for books on the library shelves, I discovered MySQL, a web-side database language. To use it, I had to learn programming languages, and at the same time, I wanted to make my own website. Seeing in one book saying "Apache MySQL PHP three musketeers". So I learned PHP, also by borrowing books myself, configuring Apache myself, and practicing myself. I took many detours at that time, but I enjoyed it.

But at that time, I still wasn't clear about my direction, thinking that making websites was just my hobby, not work. At that time, I also thought about learning telecommunications well and going to companies like ZTE and Huawei, which were very good in the words of teachers and counselors.

Thinking about it now, still too young, too simple.

I got a second-class scholarship in the second semester of freshmen year, 800 yuan. I was extremely happy then. After being in school for more than ten years, it was the first time I got a scholarship. I could show off to my family and make them happy too.

#### Sophomore year learned to distinguish

In sophomore year, I still stupidly learned Web and started looking at some books on website design. When learning PHP, I also learned front-end things by the way. But in sophomore year, I was mainly tossing background things.

But at that time, I still felt that making websites was just an interest. Of course, many people also said this: "If academic performance is good, many companies will want you". Now I feel it's not actually true.

After that, I did internet projects for a while with senior brothers in Haowang. I was in a group with senior sister Xinran then. We did the "Xidian Tree Hole" project together. Two people spent a month on a simple API (thinking back now, my character was too good at that time, unexpectedly could toss for a month for something I couldn't think of). But finally, we made it, and it supported anonymous sending of fresh news from WeChat side and webpage side to Renren public page. It should be the first tree hole written in PHP at that time. I feel a bit excited thinking about it. At that time, Xiao Xiao wanted to create an ignition point on Renren to make everyone follow this public account. However, what I never expected was that soon Renren API upgraded to 2.0, and API 1.0 all failed. I felt like being f***ed by a dog. After that, this project hastily ended. Renren has also hastily ended now.

Then I was recommended to intern at Wu Ge's place, and started doing Web commercial outsourcing projects with Wu Ge. I did several projects, among which I had the deepest impression of the [Xi'an Concert Hall](http://www.xianch.com/){:target="_blank"} project. I wrote both front-end and background myself. That year of learning technology with Wu Ge was a year of great progress in project experience.

Regarding the study of sophomore courses, the physics teacher was changed in the first semester of sophomore year. The lecture was really not good. I slowly started to develop an aversion to some subjects, especially physics. As a result, I later skipped classes to go to the library to study by myself. My favorite subject in high school was physics, and I originally applied for the telecommunications major thinking it was related to physics. This teacher shattered my "physics dream" at once. Thinking back now, it's also good.

Sophomore year was still about preparing well for exams and studying well. In the final exam month, I was often called out for self-study and giving lectures to others for revision.

After sophomore year ended, my average grade on the academic affairs office website rose by 10 points. Still a second-class scholarship. At this time, I felt 800 yuan was a bit little, after soaking in the library for so long only 800 yuan...

Sophomore year was only about learning to distinguish what I liked and who I liked, and making choices and focuses. At that time, I mainly thought about striving for recommended postgraduate study. It would definitely be more competitive after graduating from graduate school. But at that time, I had started spending more time learning Web knowledge and coding. I still did both front-end and back-end. But the premise was to finish school homework first and then do it if there was free time. But I felt I did homework very quickly then, because this would leave more time to learn my favorite Web.

In sophomore year, I at least learned to distinguish good and bad.

#### Junior year goals gradually became clear

Junior year should be a relatively difficult year to choose, but I had already started not liking the telecommunications major. Subjects like telecommunications principles and random signal analysis were really not liked but not disliked either. I still learned them and took exams as usual. I still went to every session of the so-called important courses. The courses in the third year of the School of Telecommunications were based on difficulty, four heavenly books. If I skipped one class, I wouldn't know if I could understand it by self-studying for an afternoon. So after weighing the pros and cons, going to class would be better.

I liked Web more in junior year. At that time, when looking for an internship in the first semester of junior year, my information was not very well-informed. Basically, I went to Dajie.com to look for internship recruitment information myself.

It happened that I was very interested in Web security at that time. I even thought about seeing if I could crack other people's websites or something, and then borrowed Web security books to learn. Like XSS attack, CSRF attack, DDos attack, hacker social engineering attack. But my own practice, none of them succeeded, I only learned a little bit. Thinking back now, I was so funny then.

When looking for an internship, I saw NSFOCUS recruiting Web security engineers, and then sent my resume. Then I received a written test notice, and went there without much preparation. I remember it was raining that day, but this should be the most comfortable written test I did in all my subsequent job hunts. The questions were all about Web, including PHP, MySQL, front-end, and simple Web security knowledge. Although there were many contents, it was very comfortable to do. Their written test and interview were on the same day. About 20 minutes after the papers were collected, I was notified that the written test passed and I should prepare for the interview. I thought I would be very nervous, but I wasn't. The interview place was a meeting room with a projector. I had a very happy conversation with the interviewer, and used the projector to demonstrate the Xi'an Concert Hall project by the way. We chatted for about an hour and a half and both forgot the time. For the first time, I felt that technical talk could last so long.

Finally, the HR chatted simply. In short, I felt very happy. Went back to wait for notice. About 3 days later, I received a call to go to the department boss interview. I even prepared for a long time for it. At that time, I also reviewed the Linux commands I learned before. There was one Linux question in the written test I didn't solve and was afraid of being asked. As a result, no technical questions were asked at all, just asking about my situation and if I was willing to intern. Finally I agreed. The time they set was to go to the Beijing headquarters from May to June, with free board and lodging and internship salary. I was extremely happy. At that time, I also met a good friend named Hu Bin. He was doing Windows underlying security, and I felt he was much more powerful than me. At the same time, he disliked his subject more than me (letting a small hacker who did security learn antenna technology, giving a feeling that's hard to say). I felt two people were very congenial about technical topics, and afterwards we often discussed interesting technical problems in our respective fields together. My first technical friend.

But things took a turn. The college resolutely disagreed with going out for internship during classes. I originally planned to go regardless of school, but thinking about it, I couldn't be willful. It would be GG if I got suspended. At the same time, I thought about recommended postgraduate study, couldn't fall behind in lessons, couldn't fail subjects, so I didn't go.

Regarding the evaluation of the school, you can go to see the answer [How is the experience of studying at Xi'an University of Electronic Science and Technology? Awoooo](http://www.zhihu.com/question/24394226/answer/38531518){:target="_blank"}. Although many likes were clicked by Zou Yu using our phones when we were having dinner outside, the answer was very reasonable.

After that, I accompanied Zou Yu to participate in the Huawei machine test, and I also participated by the way. I really had the courage to participate in the machine test even though I didn't remember C language anymore, using my PHP way of writing to do the questions, and then passed. Finally I went to Huawei for internship.

Afterwards, I learned that I had the qualification for recommended postgraduate study. Initially, I thought that if I found my ideal job, I wouldn't go to graduate school and would directly go to work, otherwise I would go to graduate school. As a result, still too young, too simple. The notice from the college side didn't count, changed again and again, and finally became that recommended postgraduate study also required participating in the Excellent Research Plan written test and interview. Therefore, during the internship at Huawei, I simply gave up the recommended postgraduate study and left the opportunity to other students who needed it more. And I established my goal, which was to find an internet job in Web development.

I interned at Huawei from July 16, 2014 to October 16, a full 3 months. Every day back and forth between school and company. I always took the bus before, which was really too stupid. After a long time, I found out that taking the shuttle bus was very comfortable and not crowded. Every day I got up around 6:30 am to catch the shuttle bus, and then went outside the school with Li Fan and Chen Fuqiang to take a car to the Fuzhang Village station, about 3 stops and 7 minutes. Every time I arrived at the Xifudadao West Mouth shuttle bus point around 7:17 am, taking the shuttle bus to the company. During the period, I also got acquainted with the driver. Every day the three of us chatted with the driver, very happy. Here I met two more good friends.

Arrived at Huatian Technology around 8 am. First went for fingerprint sign-in, and then went to the Huatian canteen which was extremely unpalatable and much more expensive than the school for breakfast. Then worked from 8:30 am to around 12 o'clock. Before noon, the department always ordered Monster delivery, a very good delivery. About a month later, probably lost money, that WeChat delivery actually closed down. After that, every noon I went to that Huatian canteen which was extremely unpalatable, crowded and expensive to have a casual bite. After eating, I came back and took out the military bed under the workstation, lying on it to play with the phone. The network speed was extremely slow, waiting for half a day to refresh Weibo, and don't even think about any wifi. The wake-up song started to play around 2:06 pm, then got up and started working again. Around 5:30 pm, I ran to take the company ferry bus to the software park side to take the shuttle bus back several stops before the school. Finally took any extremely crowded bus back to school. However, going to and from work with Li Fan, Hei Hei and Chen Pang was quite interesting, but a day of tossing was actually a bit tired.

During the internship, I started to make the Portal website of the cloud computing information self-service platform for the department. It took about a month to finish it, actually half a month was enough, and afterwards I kept optimizing, however it was of no use. The supervisor and mentor thought it was very good. It might be that the big supervisor above was afraid that if the original Portal became this mode, users would be unaccustomed and couldn't find the information they needed, so it didn't go online. But the code stayed in the company. Afterwards, the work was adding things to that original Portal, like focus scrolling images, tab labels and such things. After it was finished, the departments in Chengdu and Shenzhen also used this version of Portal. Then I modified the help document reading page for the department. The original one was a web page from long long ago, even compatible with IE4 you dare believe. But I could only modify on that, and needed to be compatible with all browsers. I almost had a big head. After it was finished, I gave everyone a lecture through a phone screen sharing meeting on how to use Portal and this data page. The 3 months of internship was just doing these things.

The last two months above should belong to senior year.

This was pretty much my junior year life. I met several good brothers in technology, not many, but enough. Goals gradually became clear, and I also decided to strengthen knowledge in front-end.

Still a second-class scholarship, but I didn't care anymore, had no feeling.

#### Senior year no longer hesitate

Several partners who interned at Huawei with me all resigned around early September, because they had to find jobs in campus recruitment and didn't intend to stay at Huawei. I didn't resign and still interned there, because I had a project in hand and just started it. Leaving would make me feel sorry for everyone.

But I also had to prepare for campus recruitment. Basically every day after coming back from work, I submitted resumes online, and at night I went to library area A to read books on JavaScript to prepare for interviews. I took leave for written tests and interviews when the time came. There were not many good companies, mostly in September. My basic technical knowledge was not strong, and at the same time my C language algorithm was not good. Many internet companies' front-end written tests actually hardly tested front-end questions, mostly C language and data structures. I didn't know at all those slightly difficult algorithms, basically had no choice. Like Xiaomi's test paper, all development engineers' questions were the same, not many questions but very difficult, presenting a problem scenario and asking you to write an algorithm program to solve it. The test papers of Innovation Works and Meituan also had no front-end at all. They also had one set of test papers for all development engineers. Generally couldn't finish the questions, they were all C language questions of average difficulty, and all were big questions. Tencent also had same question types for development engineers, mostly testing basic knowledge in computer software. It wasn't very difficult, but I hadn't contacted them, so I still couldn't do them. For other companies, like Baidu, Sogou, Netease (online test), YY etc. their questions were still very humane, for front-end they tested front-end related.

Initially there were few interview opportunities I liked in September, and finally I was basically unsatisfied. Finally I signed with Huawei.

After contacting the Huawei internship, I returned to school. Started doing the commercial project "Where to Learn" on October 16, realized my deficiencies (mentioned before), started to change, and contacted new things.

Afterwards, in the first semester of senior year, I had time to take a commercial project for a golf website, being responsible for the back-end part. I started to study the official English documentation of PHP Symfony2. Basically all related documents were in English. It truly exercised my patience in reading English. This process was super useful for later learning other Web knowledge, or sometimes I was more willing to read foreign Web documents.

In senior year my direction was very clear and goal was also very clear. So I wasn't worried if learning things would affect academic performance. At the same time I had much time, only learning Web related things, and didn't look at telecommunications much.

In the second semester of senior year, I chose a graduation design topic related to network security protocol SSL, a topic with a little connection to Web. I didn't like it much, but didn't dislike it. Finally used Node to write server and client, felt very good.

Late at night on May 28, I was caught in the second random check of the school's blind review. The first time I wasn't caught didn't count, felt very unhappy.
From May 29 to June 1, I kept revising the thesis, and finally ended the school blind review with "appropriate revision". But it wasn't troublesome, just revise imperfect places and get the mentor's signature.
Defended on June 18, the battle line of graduation design was a bit long. But I was also excited, finally graduating soon and could go to work.

The defense was very relaxed, teachers didn't really listen. But I "talked nonsense" about Node solemnly, and some teachers took out phones to take pictures of the PPT, felt like a successful recommendation.

Final result was Good.

I feel that the biggest change in my university stage was no longer hesitating, being more decisive, and not living by making do.

### Conclusion

There is a feeling of murmuring.

There is a sentence in Han Han's "The Continent", "Heard many truths, but still can't live this life well". Many times teaching others you should do this or that is actually useless. There is another layer of thing between truth and reality called "method".

So "It is precisely because we listened to too many truths that we can't live this life well".

Persist in what you love, direction is correct, and pay corresponding effort for it, the ideal will finally appear.

Who says hobby cannot be one's profession? Just follow your heart.

I feel that turning childhood love into work is as satisfying as turning youth love into wife.
