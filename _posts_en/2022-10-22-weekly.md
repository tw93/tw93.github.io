title: Trendy Weekly 100th Issue, Made a Website
date: 2022-10-22 19:00:00
summary: Before, Trendy Weekly was put on Github, which was not very easy to use. Taking advantage of the National Day holiday, I learned Astro and designed and developed a website for Trendy Weekly myself. It finally feels more comfortable. Sharing it with everyone.

## Origin

Trendy Weekly originated from a discussion in the internal team two years ago. Colleagues reported that the current trendy front-end technology atmosphere in the team was not strong, so a Flag was set up to share trendy technology with everyone every week. Then came Trendy Weekly. Currently, it has reached 100 issues, but it has always been presented as internal documents, which is not a big problem.

Later, some friends who went to other departments asked if there was an external version, so I put it directly on the Github Readme for a while, but the display effect was not very good, and I also have OCD. Taking advantage of the National Day holiday, I learned Astro and designed and developed a website for Trendy Weekly myself. It finally feels more comfortable. Sharing it with everyone. For example, students who have needs for weekly newsletters or looking for blog templates can Fork it. Everyone is also welcome to subscribe to [RSS]( https://weekly.tw93.fun/rss.xml).

There may be some design or usage issues with the website, welcome to point out and communicate.

## Finally

- Hope like-minded friends like it. In fact, writing a weekly is more like a "Moments" recording the non-boring life of a programmer, and also a channel for technical viewpoint exchange.
- Using [Astro]( https://astro.build/) found that this framework is very good, low learning cost, can be understood as the feeling of Nextjs for content display websites, packaging and compiling using Vite, and handling document-like Node operations is also very convenient. Interested parties can also try it.
