Personally, I really dislike the "front-end entertainment industry" atmosphere. Recently, the "Twelve Zodiac Animals of Front-End" even appeared on Twitter. For a moment, I didn't know if it was self-deprecation or entertainment.

I believe that the tech community should have more technical exchanges,碰撞, and sharing, rather than chasing attention and creating drama. Too much of this makes people perceive it as an entertainment industry. Many times, things that develop illogically are more likely to attract traffic and discussion, further pushing this atmosphere forward and making it worse.

I think front-end is one of the most interesting programming roles, a comprehensive blend of ideas, programming skills, and aesthetics. "Hackers and Painters" is a particularly apt description. It was after reading this book in the university library that I switched from back-end to front-end. At that time, I preferred writing CSS/Canvas/WebGL more than JS, because I could create particularly cool effects with code and repeatedly modify something until I was satisfied. This process was very enjoyable.

Ten years ago, the domestic tech atmosphere was really good. Many seniors shared various technical implementations, and technical discussions in the community were lively. CNode was very helpful to me at that time. Many people genuinely shared without expecting anything in return. It was these guides who attracted many students to understand front-end, learn front-end, and finally find a job they loved and could make money from.

I very much hope that the current tech atmosphere can improve in terms of open source, sharing, and technical exchanges. Of course, there are also many tech friends whom I super admire on Twitter, sharing AI, technical ideas, and good products they've recently made, guarding this area that tech people love.

Finally, I want to conclude with Brother Chen Hao's words from his article "Talking about My 'Three Views'" regarding society:

> "Spend more time on ideas that are meaningful to yourself and society. Spending time gossiping about others, spreading rumors, will neither improve your life nor help you grow, nor will it enhance your influence. Remember, your influence is not your ability to gossip about others, but how many people trust you and seek your help. Therefore, make more friends with ideas, and put your ideas into practice more often. Even if you don't succeed, your life will be more meaningful than others."
