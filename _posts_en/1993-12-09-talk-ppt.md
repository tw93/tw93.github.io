# What is an Engineer?

- A **professional** who solves problems through scientific and technical knowledge.
- Possesses professional skills and **innovation/problem-solving abilities**.

<h2 style="margin-bottom:-40px;margin-top:48px">Premise</h2> <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

- We are not "code monkeys" <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- We are not "resources" <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- We are knowledge workers with specialized skills <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

---

## What does "doing things clearly" mean?

- The matter itself is understood clearly, without doubt or **confusion** <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Clear understanding of the content, steps, and conditions, leading to smooth execution.

## Talk is cheap, show me the action.

# How Engineers Can Do Things Clearly

1. Clarify the problem
2. Explain it well
3. Execute effectively

<br>
When you clarify the what, why, and how, the process becomes logical and enjoyable.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

---

# How to **Clarify** the Problem

---

## Briefly summarize the problem

1. What is the original demand/problem?
2. Why solve it? What's the impact if not solved? **Doing nothing is sometimes the highest efficiency 🙊**<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
3. What is the root cause?
4. Can others understand this definition?

<br><br>🌰: Found that wireless usage is significantly lower than PC. Troubleshooting revealed several blockers. Not solving this will hurt user efficiency.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

---

## My commonly used thinking models

1. MECE: Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive **Categorization**<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
2. Attribution Tracing: Backtracking to find deep causes **Hypothesis**<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
3. 5W2H: What, Who, Where, When, Why, How, How Much **Perspective**<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

---

# MECE Principle

Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive. Used to break down a large problem into non-overlapping and comprehensive sub-problems.

- Binary: Two parts (e.g., domestic/foreign)
- Process: Time sequence (e.g., SOP)
- Elements: Key components
- Formula: Math (e.g., Total Time = Frontend + Network + API)
- Matrix: 2 dimensions, 4 quadrants (e.g., Important/Urgent)

---

# Attribution Tracing

A method to find the real cause by **step-by-step elimination and analysis** of multiple possibilities, starting from the result.

<br>

**🌰: A video app's playback stability suddenly dropped by 30%. How to find the issue?**<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

<br>

🤔: System? -> Network? -> Phone brand? -> App version?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

---

# 5W2H Method

- 🐝 What, Who, Where, When, Why, How, How Much
- 💡 Use when **planning a product** to clarify pain points.
- 🥸 Use self-questioning to **discover deep causes**.

<br>

<p style="font-size: 32px">💡: What product -> When to launch -> Where to use -> Why do it -> Who are the users -> How to implement -> How much cost</p><!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
<p style="font-size: 32px">🥸: 1940s, Jefferson Memorial walls had more cracks. Detergent issue? Actually: wall dirt -> bird droppings -> swallows -> spiders -> insects -> lighting.</p><!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

---

# How to judge if it's clarified?

- Any confusion left?
- Any overlooked points?
- Do you feel completely untroubled?
- Can you answer any argument from others?

# After thinking it through, how to **Explain it well**?

<h1 style="text-align:left">Or 💡<br>How to make <b>colleagues</b> understand clearly</h1>

# How to write clear documentation

1. **Logical structure**: Headings, subheadings, mind maps first.
2. **Simple expression**: Clear, logical, and easy-to-understand language.
3. **Appropriate examples**: Real or simulated cases, demos, flowcharts.

<br><br>How to judge: Others can start coding just by looking at your doc 🤓<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

---

# Check RFC

Request for Comments, a format for internet standards.
</br></br>

1. Clarify target audience and purpose.
2. Describe background and existing solutions.
3. Elaborate on the solution with logic and details.
4. Note unresolved issues and future possibilities.

---

# Documentation Anti-patterns

- Writing different docs for different people just to be "safe"?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Making simple logic complex to look "powerful"?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Using too many buzzwords?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Faking it because of a deadline?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

---

# Is explaining easy once it's written clearly? 😖

---

# Feeling nervous when speaking?

1. Everyone feels nervous; experts are just more practiced.
2. Your nervousness is usually not visible to others.
3. Preparation brings confidence and reduces anxiety.

# STAR Model for Communication

- Situation: The specific **context**.
- Task: The problem or **task** at hand.
- Action: The **actions** taken.
- Result: The **result** of those actions.

<br><br>
🌰: How we plan to solve the performance issue of XXX?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

---

# SCQA Model for Persuasion

- Situation: Start with a familiar **context**.
- Complication: A **conflict** or obstacle.
- Question: What is the **problem**?
- Answer: Our **solution**.

<br>

🤦🏻‍♀️🌰: A classic ad: "Got nail fungus? One infects two. What to do? Use Liangjia!" <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

# Signs of **Failing** to explain clearly 🥲

- The audience is distracted or sleepy.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- No questions or discussions, just "okay".<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Constant arguments and confusion.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Thinking: "I'm just too advanced for them to understand".<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

# Last but not least

---

# How to be a "Clear" Engineer?

---

# 1️⃣ Have professional skills

---

# 2️⃣ Explain things clearly

# 3️⃣ Solve various problems

---

# 4️⃣ Have PM capabilities to finish tasks

---

# 5️⃣ Keep learning and tinkering

---

# 6️⃣ Understand how to make easy-to-use products
