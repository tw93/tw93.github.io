## Introducing Pake

**Open Source Address: <https://github.com/tw93/Pake>**

A very simple tool for packaging web pages into very small Mac Apps using Rust, underlying Tauri. Currently supports WeChat Reading, Twitter, Yuque, RunCode, Witeboard, Flomo, Vercel, etc. The technical content is actually not high, just an attempt to use Rust to replace the old idea of shell web pages. Old wine in new bottles. In fact, PWA / Electron is also very easy to use and convenient.

Pake is special in that compared to traditional Electron shell packaging, it is nearly 40 times smaller, usually around 2M. In addition, due to the underlying Rust Tauri framework, the performance experience is lighter and faster than the JS framework, and the memory is much smaller. In addition, it implements general shortcut key passthrough, container communication, style rewriting injection, immersive window, dragging, simplified usage process optimization and other functions. It has a little playability. You can Fork and package what you like.

Here I mainly introduce the "packaging a minimalist Twitter Mac client with Pake" that I have been tossing recently.

## Minimalist Twitter

Using Pake combined with the open source thomaswang/minimal-twitter style injection rewrite, it took about 1 hour to package a minimalist Twitter version that you might like. It is still only about 2M. Compared with the official one, it looks much more comfortable. It gets rid of the messy things and optimizes a lot of OCD experiences. The effect is as follows.

## Finally

In fact, Pake is a small project that I did unintentionally. At that time, I was used to using Mac to read WeChat Reading, and found that there was only a web version, so I packaged one myself. Later, many people came to ask how to do it, so I put the code on Github. In fact, the code is very simple, but the idea of using Rust to package is relatively new, including many contributors who participated in the [construction](https://github.com/tw93/Pake/issues/39) later. I wanted to make it more perfect, easier to use than [foreign paid Electron packaging tools](https://www.google.com/search?q=Turn+any+webpage+into+a+real+Mac+App&newwindow=1&sxsrf=ALiCzsaRyaZYGi04wFCtU6HTi72nQnxGCg%3A1667610724145&ei=ZLhlY9XKCMHdkPIPs9G4qAE&ved=0ahUKEwjVjNiG7pX7AhXBLkQIHbMoDhUQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=Turn+any+webpage+into+a+real+Mac+App&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnC4AQP4AQL4AQFI7AFQAFgAcAB4AcgBAJABAJgBAKABAKoBAOIDBCBNGAHiAwQgQRgA4gMEIEYYAIgGAQ&sclient=gws-wiz-serp), satisfying a wave of enthusiasts is enough.
