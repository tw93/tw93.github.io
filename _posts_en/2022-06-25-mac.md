> **Why do poor students have so much stationery**, you will understand after reading this.

## For Writing

Markdown note applications should be the area I tossed the most. I started using Markdown during college. From WizNote at the beginning, to Marxico later, used Ulysses when working, then found Quiver and used it for a long time. I also used MWeb, bought Bear's annual membership, but finally, there was not a single one that satisfied me.

2 years ago I made [MiaoYan](https://miaoyan.app/), continuously optimizing it. I think the experience and usage habits are quite suitable for engineer thinking. Markdown lovers can try it~

1. Common configuration: After downloading, open settings and choose an empty folder as the knowledge base directory, then put documents in it. At the same time, you can configure your accustomed font, appearance, etc., and you can use it directly.
2. Memorize common shortcut keys to get twice the result with half the effort.
3. You can export the file order in Quiver into folders and migrate to the MiaoYan folder for seamless use.

Life records are generally used with Mac's own Notes, which can be synchronized with mobile phones and is convenient. Yuque is also very good for work documents. Quiver can be deleted.

## Common Software
