Leveraging the recent holiday break, I took the opportunity to tidy up a list of Mac software, websites, and daily life gadgets that I've found particularly useful over the past year. I've always valued simplicity, ease of use, and beauty in my tools, hoping to provide some guidance when you face similar dilemmas in choice.

## Mac Software

This year, I didn't venture into new software territories as much as refining and optimizing my current toolkit for a more comfortable usage experience. I aimed to avoid duplicating tools with similar functionalities, keeping to the principle of simplicity and beauty. Here are some of the Mac applications I've favored this year. If you're into experimenting with new tools, you might find some of these worth downloading and trying out.

5. [**Top Calendar**](https://guojiubo.github.io/zh/): A menu bar calendar app that shows the calendar, holidays, lunar calendar, and upcoming schedules, all in a beautiful interface.

### Efficiency Tools

1. [**Edge Browser**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge?ep=313&form=MA13M0&es=40): I have a love-hate relationship with this browser. I tried Arc but found it somewhat complex, barely lasting a week. The primary reason I stick with Edge is its vertical tab bar and impressive performance speed. I've written about my browser journey in 2023 in this blog post, [My 2023 Browser Odyssey](https://tw93.fun/2023-08-20/edge.html), for reference.
2. [**Thorium Browser**](https://thorium.rocks/): Since Edge isn't the most aesthetically pleasing, I discovered this super-fast browser mid-year that allows for considerable customization. I switch to it from time to time, and who knows, it might one day replace Edge entirely.
3. [**ScreenFlow**](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm): My go-to software for screen recording and video editing. It's a durable piece of software that's both simple and powerful. I primarily use it for product demos and speeding up videos.
4. [**TotalFinder**](https://totalfinder.binaryage.com/): A powerful Finder alternative that brings a Chrome-like multi-tab experience to Finder while maintaining a familiar look and adding several useful features, such as cut and paste.
5. [**App Cleaner & Uninstaller**](https://nektony.com/mac-app-cleaner): A software uninstallation tool essential for someone who frequently tests new software. This tool performs clean uninstalls with an attractive interface and useful features.
6. [**Stash**](https://stash.ws/): A tool for bypassing internet censorship. Its multi-platform support, especially for Apple TV, mobile phones, and computers, means I don't have to fuss with settings. Plus, the developer is continuously updating it, which is great.
7. [**Dozer**](https://github.com/Mortennn/Dozer): Helps hide unnecessary app icons from the top menu bar. As someone with OCD, I only allow essential software icons to be visible.
8. [**Input Source Pro**](https://inputsource.pro/zh-CN): A tool developed by a friend for automatically switching input methods. It's been very reliable and has saved me a lot of time.
9. [**Drop**](http://dropyourcolor.com/): A color picker tool, especially useful during UI development when you're looking to match a visually appealing color palette by examining the colors used in well-designed software.
10. [**DMG Canvas**](https://www.araelium.com/dmgcanvas): A tool for editing and creating dmg packages for Mac development. It's straightforward and easy to use.

## Tool Websites

This time, I've selected a batch of my frequently used websites for learning, audio-visual content, tools, and resources from nearly 50 articles published in [**Trend Weekly**](https://weekly.tw93.fun/) in 2023.

### IT Devices

1. **Computer**: MacBook Pro M2 32GB 16-inch Space Gray, significantly faster than the 2019 model. I opt for larger screens since I don't use external monitors.
2. **Phone**: iPhone 15 Pro 256GB in the original color, a noticeable upgrade in appearance and texture from the 13 Pro, and lighter. I recommend purchasing the best device your budget allows for everyday use.
3. **Headphones**: AirPods Pro2, having used Pro1 for about 3 years before selling all other headphones. Now, this is my only headphone, fully satisfying my daily needs.
4. **Watch**: Apple Watch Series 7 in starlight, bought a few years ago. It's a beautiful but somewhat frivolous item. If used merely as a watch, it's not worth it, but for decoration and health monitoring, it's acceptable.
5. **Router**: [Xiaomi AX9000](https://u.jd.com/jiNKzm2), a large black device with strong performance and speed, covering the entire house. Paired with affordable broadband, it provides a smooth experience watching 4K Netflix videos.
6. **Chair**: Yongyi Ergonomic Chair MC-1128E in grey white, with adjustable backrest and waist support, hidden pull-out footrest, and reclining feature. Purchased from Sam's, it offers great comfort and value for money.
7. **Desk Lamp**: [Mi Desk Lamp 1S Enhanced Edition in Night Black](https://u.jd.com/jsNCMq0), previously mentioned on Twitter, is exquisitely made and aesthetically pleasing, ideal for computer use and reading.
8. **Power Bank**: [Anker 10000mAh 30W with built-in cable](https://u.jd.com/juNMRUw), bought for a trip and found to be very useful and attractive. It's convenient for charging other devices in the living room without plugging in.

### Home Theater

<img src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/k/1k/IMG_5816.jpg" width="900" />

1. **Box**: [Apple TV 7](https://u.jd.com/julUGD5), as recommended on Twitter and in my blog post [My Entry into Home Cinema](https://tw93.fun/2023-09-29/tv.html): Apple TV is the product of the year for its simplicity and ease of use.
2. **TV**: [Sony X90L 75 inches](https://u.jd.com/jiNLA2v), chosen for its value after comparing many models offline. The experience confirms that there's Sony and then there's everything else. However, if affordable, I recommend getting the largest TV possible.
3. **Sound System**: [Samsung Q600B Soundbar + Rear Surround 9200S](https://u.jd.com/jsNMT51), reasonably priced and significantly better than the TV's built-in speakers. If you have a soundbar, adding rear surround speakers is highly recommended.

### Small Appliances

1. **Coffee Machine**: De'Longhi ECP33.21.W, a semi-automatic coffee machine that is the greatest source of happiness in my life. I've recommended its accessories on Twitter before; I absolutely love it.
2. **Air Fryer**: Panasonic NF-HCSAM400, bought on a whim at Sam's for 299. It's frequently used for baking bread and chicken wings, performing well and looking great in white.
3. **Rice Cooker**: [Toshiba 1H RC-10HPC](https://u.jd.com/jqNQ2Wh), purchased to enjoy fragrant, fluffy rice, unanimously approved by my family as making delicious rice.

### Big Items

1. **Toy Car**: Tesla Model 3 in red, looks just like the toy cars I adored in my childhood. I love products with a simple beauty. It's been over 2 years since the purchase, and the pros far outweigh the cons, expanding my life's radius significantly.
2. **Bicycle**: [Dahon P8 Matte Black Folding Bike](https://u.jd.com/j8Nrpae), I absolutely adore this bike. Purchased offline, it rides wonderfully. I've written about [My Entry into Bicycling](https://tw93.fun/2023-10-06/dahang.html) which you might find helpful.
3. **Washing Machine**: LG Washer-Dryer Combo [FY11MW4 + RH10V9PV2W](https://u.jd.com/jqN6U4A), I did a lot of research before buying a washing machine. Many online photos make them look fancy, but in person, the quality feels average. After much consideration, LG stood out in terms of cost-effectiveness and aesthetics. The experience has been great, with clothes washed and dried without fuss.
4. **Refrigerator**: Panasonic [NR-W591-CP-W](https://u.jd.com/j8NuXJo) French Door Fridge in white. The good-looking ones were either too expensive or the wrong size. This model was just right in price, size, functionality, and aesthetics. Little Red Book has many best practices for choosing a fridge, worth a look offline, but the primary selection criterion should be the size.
5. **Mattress**: Serta Shaun Mattress. Choosing a mattress was the most labor-intensive of all purchases because there are so many brands, and you really need to sleep on one to know how it feels. Many seemed overpriced to me. My first consideration was comfort, reminiscent of the mattresses in five-star hotels. After some research, I found that Hilton and Marriott use Serta, so I ended up buying one offline. The sense of being enveloped is strong, facilitating quick sleep, and it's quiet when turning over.
6. **Water Purifier**: [A.O. Smith Janette CAR800-FA1](https://u.jd.com/jzNnCp5), making it unnecessary to buy bottled water for home use anymore. It supports hot, warm, and cold drinking water directly, with a great cost-performance ratio. The only downside is if I need a lot of hot water at once, it requires a few sessions, but luckily, that's a rare scenario.

### Smart Tools

1. **Doorbell**: [Xiaomi Smart Doorbell 3](https://u.jd.com/j8NqbVV), this sub-300 item I consider the most worthwhile purchase. A single charge lasts half a year, serving as both an outdoor camera and doorbell. Installed above the door lock, it matches the existing lock without being obtrusive.
2. **Hand Washing Device**: [SUPOR Automatic Foam Hand Washing Device](https://u.jd.com/j8NQOLH), incredibly practical in the bathroom. Fill it with hand soap, and a single charge lasts half a year. Place your hand under the dispenser for automatic foam delivery.
3. **Electric Toothbrush**: [Usmile Y10 in Obsidian Black](https://u.jd.com/jqNDKyJ), reasonably priced with a charge lasting half a year. Features a small screen displaying battery life and mode, and it even detects if you've missed spots, offering much better value compared to other brands I've bought before.
4. **Speaker**: [XiaoAi Speaker Pro](https://u.jd.com/j8N3TjW) in black. After using other speakers, I found they weren't as smart. XiaoAi does the job well without being overly talkative, making it a decent choice for central control of home devices.
5. **Curtains**: [Mi Smart Curtain 1S](https://u.jd.com/jQNs0rz), automatic bedroom curtains are, in my opinion, the most useful smart device. "Open in the morning, close at night," just one command. Why Xiaomi? Mainly because I'm not too familiar with this area and went for the best value for money.
6. **Vacuum Robot**: [Roborock P10 Pro](https://u.jd.com/jsNrhK3), performs well, though it's a bit noisy, which seems common for most vacuum robots. After some research, I chose this one and have hardly needed to mop since. Setting it to clean automatically when I'm out has been liberating.
7. **Balcony Light**: [Midea Radar Light Sensing Human Body Sensor Ceiling Light](https://u.jd.com/j8NrYv3), I replaced the previous light, and now it automatically turns on and off just by satisfying the conditions of being nighttime and someone moving outside, which is quite convenient.
8. **Thermohygrometer**: [Xiaomi Thermohygrometer 3](https://u.jd.com/juN3sm4), serves as a beautiful decoration that quietly does its job. However, checking the temperature and humidity at home from time to time is quite nice.

---

In conclusion, life needs a bit of fun. Keep tinkering, keep loving, stay young, and keep your passion alive. I wish you happiness just the same.
